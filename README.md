## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside

| Pattern                  | Description                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Two Pointers             | Efficiently solve problems using two moving indices    |
| Sliding Window           | Optimize problems involving subarrays/substrings       |
| Hash Map / Hash Set      | Track values and frequencies with fast lookups         |
| Binary Search            | Divide-and-conquer with sorted or search-friendly data |
| DFS / BFS                | Traverse trees and graphs with recursion or queues     |
| Backtracking             | Explore all combinations/permutations recursively      |
| Dynamic Programming      | Solve complex problems by reusing subproblem results   |
| Greedy Algorithms        | Make the best local choice for global optimality       |
| Linked List Manipulation | Handle pointer-based data structures cleanly           |
| Bit Manipulation         | Solve low-level problems using binary math             |

Each folder or section contains:

- ðŸ“Œ A short explanation of the pattern
- ðŸ§© 5 popular LeetCode problems with links
- âœ… Suggestions for how to practice and master them

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

You can view the patterns right here in the repo or copy them into your own study notes.

I recommend:

1. Pick a pattern (e.g. Sliding Window)
2. Solve 2â€“3 beginner problems
3. Revisit them later and solve again without looking
4. Build muscle memory and recognize the pattern across different problems
