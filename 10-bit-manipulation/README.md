# Bit Manipulation Pattern

## 🔍 Pattern Overview

Bit manipulation uses binary operations to solve problems efficiently.

## 📘 When to Use

- Checking for powers of two
- Finding unique numbers using XOR
- Working within strict space/time constraints

## 🧠 Strategy

- Use bitwise operators: AND `&`, OR `|`, XOR `^`, NOT `~`, SHIFT `<<`, `>>`
- Familiarize with common bit tricks

## 📌 Example Problems

- [ ] [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)
- [ ] [Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)
- [ ] [Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)
- [ ] [Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)
- [ ] [Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

## 🧵 Time & Space Complexity

- Time: O(1) to O(log n)
- Space: O(1)
