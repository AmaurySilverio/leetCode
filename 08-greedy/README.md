# Greedy Pattern

## 🔍 Pattern Overview

Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping to find a global optimum.

## 📘 When to Use

- Optimization problems (min/max)
- When a greedy choice leads to a correct overall solution

## 🧠 Strategy

- Sort or prioritize elements
- Choose the best option at each step
- Prove that the greedy strategy is correct

## 📌 Example Problems

- [ ] [Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)
- [ ] [Greedy Algorithm - Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)
- [ ] [Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)
- [ ] [Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)
- [ ] [Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)

## 🧵 Time & Space Complexity

- Time: Often O(n log n)
- Space: O(1) or O(n)
