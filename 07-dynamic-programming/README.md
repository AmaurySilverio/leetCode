# Dynamic Programming (DP)

## 🔍 Pattern Overview

DP solves complex problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing intermediate results.

## 📘 When to Use

- Problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure
- Minimizing/maximizing a value
- Counting combinations or paths

## 🧠 Strategy

- Use recursion + memoization (top-down) or iteration + table (bottom-up)
- Identify the state and transitions

## 📌 Example Problems

- [ ] [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
- [ ] [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)
- [ ] [Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)
- [ ] [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)
- [ ] [Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

## 🧵 Time & Space Complexity

- Time: O(n), O(n²), or more (depending on the recurrence)
- Space: O(n)
