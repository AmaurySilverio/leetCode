# Hash Map / Hash Set Pattern

## 🔍 Pattern Overview

This pattern uses hash maps or sets to store and look up values in constant time.

## 📘 When to Use

- Fast lookups, insertions, and deletions
- Detecting duplicates or tracking frequency
- Solving pair/sum problems

## 🧠 Strategy

- Use objects (maps) or sets to keep count or existence of elements
- Combine with iteration patterns for efficient lookup

## 📌 Example Problems

- [ ] [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- [ ] [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)
- [ ] [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
- [ ] [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)
- [ ] [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

## 🧵 Time & Space Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)
