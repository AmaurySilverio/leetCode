# Two Pointers

## 🔍 Pattern Overview

Use two indices that move toward each other or in the same direction to reduce time complexity.

## 📘 When to Use

- Problems that involve sorted arrays
- When you need to find pairs or triplets with a specific condition
- When working with palindromes or merging two sorted arrays

## 🧠 Strategy

- Use a `left` and `right` pointer
- Move them based on condition (e.g., increasing or decreasing a sum)
- Avoid nested loops
- Common edge cases: Duplicates, negative numbers

## 📌 Example Problems

- [ ] [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
- [ ] [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
- [ ] [Valid Palidrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)
- [ ] [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

## 🧵 Time & Space Complexity

Each problem will vary, but here's a general idea:

- Time: Often O(n)
- Space: O(1)
