# Backtracking Pattern

## 🔍 Pattern Overview

Backtracking is a brute-force approach that incrementally builds solutions and backtracks when a constraint is violated.

## 📘 When to Use

- Generating permutations, combinations, or subsets
- Solving constraint satisfaction problems (e.g., Sudoku, N-Queens)

## 🧠 Strategy

- Build a solution path step by step
- Abandon a path when it becomes invalid (backtrack)
- Usually implemented recursively

## 📌 Example Problems

- [ ] [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)
- [ ] [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)
- [ ] [Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)
- [ ] [Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)
- [ ] [N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)

## 🧵 Time & Space Complexity

- Time: Exponential
- Space: Depends on recursion depth
