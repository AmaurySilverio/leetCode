# DFS & BFS (Graph Traversal)

## 🔍 Pattern Overview

These are two core traversal strategies for trees, graphs, and grids. DFS goes deep, BFS goes wide.

## 📘 When to Use

- Graph, tree, or grid traversal
- Shortest path (BFS), exhaustive search (DFS)
- Backtracking and cycle detection

## 🧠 Strategy

- Use stacks/recursion for DFS
- Use queues for BFS
- Track visited nodes to prevent cycles
