# Sliding Window

## 🔍 Pattern Overview

Keep track of a subset of data using a fixed or dynamic window to solve substring or subarray problems.

## 📘 When to Use

- Contiguous subarray/string problems
- Need to find max, min, or sum in a moving window

## 🧠 Strategy

- Use a left/right pointer to maintain a window
- Slide the window based on constraints
- Shrink/grow the window as needed

## 📌 Example Problems

- [ ] [Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)
- [ ] [Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)
- [ ] [Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)
- [ ] [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
- [ ] [Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

## 🧵 Time & Space Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1) to O(k), depending on window structure
