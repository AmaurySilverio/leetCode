# Linked List Pattern

## 🔍 Pattern Overview

Linked lists are linear data structures where each element points to the next. Many problems revolve around node manipulation.

## 📘 When to Use

- Node-by-node manipulation
- Reversing or detecting cycles
- Deletion or insertion at arbitrary positions

## 🧠 Strategy

- Use fast and slow pointers
- Handle edge cases: head, null, loops
- Consider dummy nodes for easier logic

## 📌 Example Problems

- [ ] [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
- [ ] [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
- [ ] [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
- [ ] [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
- [ ] [Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

## 🧵 Time & Space Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1) unless using extra structures
